What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The git folder and files are created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I think it defines the files which should be version controlled.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
For that, I only stage files which belong to that change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- fixing a bug while adding a feature
