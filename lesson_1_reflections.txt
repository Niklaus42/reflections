How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed the differences of the two versions and so made it easy to find the line which worked in the older version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would make it easier to find the version when a bug was introduced or when a significant change has been made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having 
versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: complete transactions
Cons: may be forgotten

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the revision history
git diff shows the exact changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It is easy to go back to the previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I will try it with my CertificateGrabber and then set it up for our Modem project.
